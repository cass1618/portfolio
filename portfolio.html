      <h3>Story</h3>
      <p>I grew up  in Sunriver, Oregon where I rode my bike, floated down the river, and learned to snowboard.
        After completing an AA degree at age 19 with a 4.2 GPA, I couldn't decide what to do with my life so I joined the Navy for 6 years.  I studied nuclear power for 2 years in South Carolina and then worked in the nuclear plant aboard the USS Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier stationed out of San Diego.  After finishing my contract I ended up living in Los Angeles for 5 years where I started bartending.  I had a great time there but eventually realized that the Pacific Northwest is where I belong!

      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>Since finding "Neurophilosophy" by Patricia Churchland in my father's bookshelf at age 8, I've always wanted to study Nerosceince but was unsure of how to go about it.  After I left the military I wanted to live in sunny Huntington Beach, CA, where I started going to Orange Coast College and taking courses required to transfer to a Nerosceince program at UCLA.  That's when I took my first Python class which I loved!  A couple years later, I started to feel that I might rather pursue something more practical such as Computer Science.  I started taking computer science courses at a University but became frustrated with the quality of education I was receiving so I dedided not to finish my degree at that school.  For a long time I've felt that a coding school would be an ideal choice so I'm very excited that I'm finally doing it.  I'd still like to finish my bachelor's degree eventually but for now I'd like to get into the industry and see what I can accomplish.
